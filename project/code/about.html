        Three decades ago, a small sweet shop was started by Late K.S. Thirupathi Raja, in the metropolis of Chennai.
        This same shop has now flowered into multiple branches that dot the length and breadth of Chennai as well as its
        neighbouring cities.<br></p>
    <p style="font-size: x-large;font-style: italic;font-weight: 600;">
        M/s. Adyar Ananda Bhavan Sweets & Snacks is now a well-established brand in Southern India that continues to
        grow with a vision to capture the global market. The baton of this sweet legacy was passed on by K.S. Thirupathi
        Raja to his sons, Mr. K.T. Venkatesan and Mr. K.T. Srinivasa Raja who now act as the driving force behind A2B.
